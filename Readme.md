# First-principle calculations of Dark Matter scattering off light nuclei

Repository containing data for publication [First-principle calculations of Dark Matter scattering off light nuclei](https://inspirehep.net/literature/1589846)

## Work in progress

This repository is work in progress and will receive a better documentation in the near future.

## Reproduce plots

To reproduce the plots, you have to install the dependencies (requires Python3)
```bash
pip install [--user] -r requirements.txt
```
and launch the `Plots-Final.ipynb` notebook via [Jupyter](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/index.html).
This notebook reproduces all plots (and more) contained in the associated documentation.
